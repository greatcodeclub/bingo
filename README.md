A an easy to learn and translated programming language targeted at people who have never used a programming language before.

A project of the http://greatcodeclub.com/.

A lot of the programming languages we use today have been designed a really long time ago. Even newer ones are still based on those old ideas. While some are good, a lot of the decision made back in the days were because of technical limitations. Bingo aims to create a language free of any technical boundaries and focus strictly on readability and ease of use for new comers.
